7b23d679-e01f-4274-9188-36e9f7d290e2,Uruguay,1930,"World Cup 1930
==============
I n 1929, it was decided that the first ever World Cup would take place in Uruguay from 13 July to 30 July 1930. Thirteen nations would be participating after accepting invitations – no qualifications took place. In 18 matches, 70 goals would be scored including the first hat-trick in World Cup history by Guillermo Stábile. When the tournament was over, Uruguay had been crowned as first World Cup champions.

Background
----------
At the time for the event, an economic depression took place in Europe. The travel expenses hindered some teams and  many of the European players were reluctant to leave their countries on a long trip, afraid that they would lose their jobs – this was long before it became normal with football players  playing for a living. The idea that professionals would be allowed caused a lot of  controversy and aversion   (only amateur players were traditionally allowed in the Olympics). That was the reason for Denmark and Germany to refuse to take part. Of prestigious reasons England would also refrain from participation. For a while it looked like none of the Europeans countries would make the trip to Uruguay and the first World Cup was in danger. In the end three European nations would send their teams to Uruguay. Unfortunately, none   of these were among the highest ranked teams. Many of the best European teams would be absent, such as Austria, England , Hungary , Italy and Spain . The European teams that finally traveled over the Atlantic would be helped economically by Uruguay that at the time was a country with great economy. The host team Uruguay was the favorite to win. They had won the Paris Olympics 1924 and in Amsterdam Olympics 1928. But on the other side had the closest rival Argentina won the South American Championship in 1929. The national team of Brazil had not yet become the powerhouse that it later would be and would arrive to the first World Cup ill-prepared (due to internal disputes, they were only represented by players from  Carioca). Besides from not being the best team from the continent, the Europeans teams would also suffer from the travel conditions: ten days on a boat without chance for training. The reason a group phase was taken into practice (which was not done in the Olympics) was actually to give the long distanced guests the pleasure to at least play two games.

Format
------
The tournament was played with a group phase followed by Semi-finals and a final (a match for third place wasn't played).

Cities and arenas
-----------------
All the matches would be played in the capital Montevideo at three different stadiums. The final would be played at Estadio Centenario with a capacity of 90,000.

Tournament
----------
An old  rivalry between Uruguay and Argentina was expressed without questions by the majority of the audience  booing the guests in their first match against France to that extent that the Argentines treated to leave the tournament. The president of Uruguay had to mediate. Yet, it was in the last match in the group between Argentina and Chile that things really got out of hand. The most players of both teams got involved in a large scrimmage after an incident between two players. After a break the match continued and Argentina won the match and also the group. Yugoslavia and USA would surprise many by winning their groups and advance to the Semi-finals. USA that had been humiliated by the Argentinians in the 1928 Olympics with 11-2 would once again be crushed by them in the Semi-finals, this time by 6-1. On behalf of the Americans pride, it should be added that two of their players were injured and –  as the bizarre rule at this time dictated –  were not allowed to be replaced. Uruguay would defeat Romania and Peru in their group and then beat Yugoslavia by a large margin in the Semi-finals. The result would not reflect the game to a full extent, however. Yugoslavia that had taken the lead had one goal disallowed by a strange decision from the referee and two of Uruguay's first goals were approved in unconvincing circumstances. In the final they faced the archenemy Argentina who also had been their opponents in the final in the 1928 Olympics tournament. In the presence of over 80,000 people at Estadio Centenario in Montevideo (the attendance figures are debated: the official attendance was 68,346, but it was undoubtedly   more people watching the game and some sources claim it was over 90,000 people), Uruguay could pull off another victory with four goals against two after Argentina had had a 2-1 lead. The football players of the Uruguay team would renew their status as the pride of the nation.

Results
-------
Uruguay would defeat Argentina in the final with 4-2.

Aftermath
---------
The friendship between the two countries would be affected  negatively for a time after the final. Players of the  Argentine side had felt threatened before the game by supporters and one player had received death threats.  Argentinian supporters would also report of being harassed during the event. As a revenge, the Uruguayan embassy in Buenos Aires got vandalized by citizens and the government cut off the relation to its neighbor country.

==============
T he second World Cup in football took place in Italy between 27 May and 10 June. In total, 16 teams were participating after proceeding a qualification phase that had included 36 teams, also the host nation was forced to take part in the qualification. The reigning Uruguay was on the other hand directly qualified, but declined to participate in protest due to the fact many European teams refrained from travel to South America four years ago when Uruguay had been World Cup host. Neither was Great Britain represented with any team since they had decided not to join FIFA.

Background
----------
At the time the FIFA World Cup 1934 was arranged Italy, the host nation, was run by Benito Mussolinis fascism party. Il Duce that had founded Seria A (the Italian football club league) a few years earlier, would take the chance to spread some political propaganda and according to some record he had also some influence over the outcome. A day before Italy's match against Austria, he had a dinner with the Swedish referee Ivan Eklind and in the following match there were  situations in which the referee could have favored the Italians. Eklind would also be the referee in the final instead of the Belgian referee that had been elected earlier. Even in this match could it be argued that the Italians was favored be the referee.
The reasons for Uruguay to decline participation was also grounded on political circumstances. Also, Argentina hesitating over their participation and in the end they would partake with an amateur team.

Format
------
The set-up for the competition had changed since the first World Cup in 1930 and the group phase was abandoned for an altogether knock-out tournament format (the group play would be reintroduced again in 1950). If the match was a tie after regular match time a period of 30 minutes extra time would take place. If the match still wasn’t decided after extra time a rematch would be arranged the following day (penalty shoot-out was not introduced until 1978).

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The matches would be played in eight cities and on eight stadiums (see “Cities and stadiums” box for overview). The final would be played in Rome on Stadio Nazionale PNF that had a capacity of 47,300. The stadium that had its name associated with the fascism, PNF was an abbreviation for Partito Nazionale Fascista .

Tournament
----------
Just  like the previous World Cup tournament, some matches were stirred up by ruction  on the field. The most scandalous scenes were probably when the Hungarian  players surrounded the referee after the match against Austria and blamed him  for their defeat. The Quarter-final between and Italy and Spain , was another  extraordinary event, with a mix of extreme brutally (including several fights)  with top class football. After a draw a replay would follow, which Spain lost. The Spanish goalkeeper Zamora was out of service in the second match due to all  mean treatment from the Italians in the first match. In Uruguay 1930 all teams had used the 2-3-5
  formation. In this World Cup two different systems would be used: W-M and the Metodo. The metodo, with a sort of 2-3-2-3 formation were developed the Italian coach Vittorio Pozzo and turned out to be most successful.

Results
-------
First round, places 9-19: United States, Brazil, France, Egypt, Romania, Netherlands, Belgium, Argentina. Quarter-finals, places 5-8: Spain, Hungary, Switzerland, Sweden. In the match of third place Germany would beat Austria with 3-2. The final was played between Italy and Czechoslovakia.
Czechoslovakia  took the lead in second half, but Italy  equalized and extra time was needed to decide the outcome. Five minutes into the extra time Angelo Schiavio  scored for Italy and the match would eventually end 2-1.
Italy would  be granted as the second World Cup champions.

c670b08f-9a6a-45e2-b6b5-d34d1871f8ad,France,1938,"World Cup 1938
==============
T he third World Cup in football took place in France 4-19 June. The fact that two World Cups in a row were held in Europe was met with anger in South America that had expected the tournament to be played in their continent every second time. This led to a boycott from Argentina and Uruguay.

Background
----------
In total 16 teams were participating after a qualification that included 37 teams (the host nation France and the reigning champions Italy was directly qualified). The World Cup in 1938 would be dominated by European nations, 13 of 16 teams were European. The most exotic team to participate was Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) that also became the first Asian team to participate in the World Cup. They had qualified since all other teams in Asia withdrew. Spain that was affected by a civil war were absent and the turbulent political climate in Europe that stood in the doorway to a great war could be noticeable. Most directly so since Austria just before the start of the tournament was annexed by the Nazi Germany and Austria was for that reason abolished. It was also noticeable in the games that included Germany or Italy by an upset audience. The Italian players made fascist salutes before the games and when they had to change to the away team shirt against France in the Quarter-finals, they would not play in white shirts as usual but black  – the fascist color.

Format
------
The format for the competition was a knock-out tournament. If the match was a tie after regular match time a period of 30 minutes extra time would take place. If the match still wasn’t decided after extra time a rematch would be arranged the following day (penalty shoot-out was not introduced until 1978).

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The matches would be played in ten French cities and on nine stadiums (see “Cities and stadiums” box for overview). However, since one match was canceled, no match was played in Lyon. This was the match between Austria and Sweden. The final would be played in Paris at Stade Olympique de Colombes that had a capacity of 60,000.

Tournament
----------
On the sporting aspects, it could be stated that Brazil for the first time made a great impact in World Cup football and with a crowd-pleasing style reached far in the tournament. The biggest surprise was probably the Cuban victory against Romania. But tired after a replay match and playing on a muddy pitch Cuba wouldn't stand for another surprise in the quarterfinals, instead they got slaughtered by Sweden.

Results
-------
First round, places 9-19: Norway, Belgium, Poland, Netherlands, Dutch East Indies, Germany, Austria, Romania. Quarter-finals, places 5-8: France, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Cuba. Italy and Hungary would win the Semi-finals and in the match of third place Brazil would beat Sweden with 4-2. The final was played between Italy and Hungary in front of 45 124 persons. The match was finally won by Italy after two goals by Gino Colaussi and Silvio Piola each. Hence, Italy would defend their World Champion title and becomes the first team with two World Cup titles. Because of the Second World War, the next World Cup had to wait until 1950.

4df6f09a-4179-4edd-88e9-aeb0b02493eb,Brazil,1950,"World Cup 1950
==============
T he fourth World Cup in football took place in Brazil between 24 June and 16 July. It was the first World Cup since 1938 – because of the Second World War no World Cup were arranged neither 1942 nor 1948. In 1946 the decision was taken to arrange a new World Cup that would take place in Brazil, far from the war-torn Europe.

Background
----------
Due to the actions in the war, both Germany and Japan was banned from the tournament. Due to political reasons, Soviet Union, Hungary and Czechoslovakia refrained  from participating. Argentina would withdraw under the qualification stage after a disagreement with Brazilian Football Confederation. France and India would withdraw for other reasons after being qualified for the tournament which resulted in asymmetrical groups.
With India and France excluded, 13 teams were in reality participating in the World Cup of football in 1950. One of the teams was England that after finally becoming a FIFA member would partake in the prestigious  tournament for the first time.
Unlike the last time the World Cup was held in South America most of the European top nations in football would partake –  this time transatlantic flight had emerged that made the long trip easier (Italy would, however travel by sea, understandable after the tragic air disaster that the year before wiped out the entire Torino football team).

Format
------
The group play that had been used in 1930, but been abandoned four years later would be put back into practice (the reason was economical). The format for World Cup 1950 was two phases of group play. Out of four groups four group winners would advance to a final group stage.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The matches would be played in six Brazilian cities and at six stadiums (see “Cities and stadiums” box for overview). The host country had built a new enormous stadium for the event, the Maracana Stadium (Estádio do Maracanã) with a capacity close to 200,000.

Tournament
----------
Because of the absence of France that had withdrawn, the Group 4 would only include one match. Uruguay would beat Bolivia in this match with 8-0 and would get an easy path to the knockout-stage.
Brazil was at this time a prosperous country, and as a football nation, it had emerged as a serious contender to the current powerhouses in South America: Uruguay and Argentina. They had won the 1949 Copa América in great fashion, scoring 39 goals in seven matches. Brazilian people breathed great optimism, but after the second group match against Switzerland was drawn the supporters were furious and the trainer Flavio Costo needed a police escort from the arena. The Brazil team would, however, advance from their group to the final round. In the second group phase no other team was near as impressive as Brazil (7-1 against Sweden and 6-1 against Spain ), and at this point the passionate football nation seemed sure of a complete victory. A chock was nevertheless waiting in the final match in which Brazil only need to draw to be world champions. Even that it officially were 173,850 at the Maracanã stadium it has estimated to be over 200,000 the 16 July when Brazil played against Uruguay in the match that would decide the outcome of the tournament. After taking a 1-0 lead Uruguay would come back and winning by two to one. The result would chock a nation and the Brazil national team who always had played in white kits would never do it again after the defeat against Uruguay.
The British football was for a long period been considered as superior in comparison with the rest of the world. In the last decades other nations had, however, taken giant steps and this would be proven when the best British nation, England, finally played in the World Cup. After one won match and two lost the fiasco was a fact  – England was eliminated before the final round.
A curiosity is that this was the first World Cup in which the players had numbers on their backs.

Results
-------
Brazil, Spain, Sweden and Uruguay succeed to win their respective groups. They would play each other in a second round that consisted of a four-team group. The last game, between Uruguay and Brazil, would be the decisive  – at this point the home team y needed only a draw to secure tournament victory. The match was played at the Maracana Stadium and is regarded as one of the most classic World Cup finals with an attendance 199,854. The result, would however not serve, the majority of the spectators. After the home team took the lead Uruguay would deliver two goals in the second half and win the match and the tournament. Uruguay who had chosen not to partake in the 1934 or 1938 tournaments collected their second title out of two participation. And their forward became the first player in World Cup to score in all games he played in.

643294d9-a484-4afe-ac6e-2bb7c32ce64c,Switzerland,1954,"World Cup 1954
==============
T he 1954 FIFA World Cup took place in Switzerland 16 June to 4 July. In total, 16 teams participated in what was the final stage of the tournament and 26 matches were played. It was the fifth time for the World Cup tournament and it would be the first that could be seen on television.

Background
----------
The defending champions Uruguay were among the teams; their national side had  so far won the tournament in every attempt. It was, however Hungary ,  the big dominant in European football at this time, which arrived in Switzerland as the biggest favorite. One of their players was the legendary Ferenc Puskás who was injured against West Germany in the group phase, but would recover for the knockout stage.
Notable was also that Scotland, South Korea and Turkey all had managed to qualify for the World Cup final for the first time (the former great power in football, Scotland, had only been a member of FIFA since 1949). Germany that had been forbidden to participate in the previous World Cup due to the actions in World War II was again welcome in the FIFA World Cup.
The atmosphere in Switzerland was  completely different from what it had been four years back in Brazil. It was a rather big contrast to the passionate audience that had filled the enormous Maracanã. It may seem strange that  such a small country as Switzerland would be the host for the biggest global football tournament in the world, but  it was one of  few European nations that hadn't been particularly affected by the recent war.

Format
------
The format  was a first phase with four four-teams group from which two teams would advance to a final knockout stage. A curious thing with the set-up for this tournament was that every team only played two group matches, and  would only meet two out of three teams. Ranking would decide which teams that would meet. Unsurprisingly, the design would be criticized. Criticized was also the idea that no concern would be taken if a team had come first or second in the group when the teams were assigned opponents in the Quarter-finals. This resulted in that a very plausible final would come off already in the Quarter-finals between Hungary and Brazil .

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The matches would be played in six cities and at six stadiums (see “Cities and stadiums” box for overview). The Wankdorf Stadium in Bern had the biggest capacity with places for over 64,000 and the final would consequently be played here.

Tournament
----------
The tournament would achieve the highest goals average ever in a World Cup with an astonishing 5.38 goals per match. Most excessive production of goals at all would come about in the Quarter-final game between Austria and Switzerland: 7-5 after 90 minutes (12 goals in one match are still a record in the tournament). Another reason was the South Korean negative record with 16 goals forfeited. Over five goals per match had never happened before and it will certainly not happen again.
In the Quarter-finals Hungary faced Brazil in a match that was mentioned as a moral final. But  the major impression of the game was not the sporting, but violent encounters on the field. The game that would be called ""Battle of Berne"" included three red cards, fights on the sideline after the final whistle and continued further with Brazilians attacking the Hungarian players in their locking room.
West Germany may be one of the biggest football nations, but the team in the 1954 World Cup lacked qualifications to a great degree and it was a big sensation when they won the Quarter-final against Yugoslavia. Even bigger was the 6-1 victory against Austria in the Semi-final. Despite the overrun against Austria, Germany was expected to stand without a chance against Hungary in the final. Anything else would be a miracle. Hungary would take a 2-0 lead, but  German morale and a muddy pitch that wouldn't serve the Hungarian passing style made it to what ever since has been called “The Miracle of Bern”.  West Germany became the winners of the tournament after  beating Hungary in a tense game with three goals to two.

Results
-------
Brazil, Yugoslavia, Hungary, West Germany, Uruguay, Austria, England and Switzerland would advance through the group phase to the knockout stage. West Germany, Austria, Hungary and Uruguay would succeed in the Quarter-finals and go on the Semi-finals. West Germany would thrash Austria with 6-1 and Hungary would defeat Uruguay after extra time.

Aftermath
---------
The Hungarian player Ferenc Puskás would after the tournament accuse the Germans of using dope. He was forced by FIFA to take back his accusations, but 50 years later testified an attendant that he had had found syringes in the Germans locking room after the final. A study made by the Berlin Humboldt University would also later confirm that systematic doping had taken place in West Germany during a long period. The same report also claimed that the German football players had taken Methamphetamine before the 1954 World Cup final.

==============
T he sixth FIFA World Cup was played in Sweden 8-29 June.  In total, 51 national teams had  tried to qualify from three regions: Latin America, Europe and Great Britain and 16 would be entering the final tournament.

Background
----------
In all previous World Cups it had always been some nations that didn't wish or weren't able to partake. In the 1958 edition all countries in the world of football were involved in the qualifications that would lead to the final tournament in Sweden. And for the first time in World Cup history, all the British nations would be qualified.
The decision of letting a European country be the host for the World Cup twice in a row would upset the South Americans. It had also happened 1934-1938, but from FIFA it was decided  that the tournament from now on  would change continent every four years.
The decision to let a relatively small country as Sweden with less than 7 million people be the host for a World Cup would also be criticized concerning the potential for big audiences. The average attendance would also be relatively low, some thousands less than  in Switzerland 1954, but actually higher than in France 1938.

Format
------
The format  consisted  of a first phase with four four-teams group and from each  two teams would advance to a final knockout stage including eight teams. The knockout stage consisted of quarter-finals, semi-finals, a third place match and a final.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The matches would be played in twelve cities in Sweden and at twelve stadiums (see “Cities and stadiums” box for overview). The final would be played at the Råsunda Stadium in the capital city, Stockholm.

Tournament
----------
Among the participants was the reigning championship West Germany , whereas another former champion team Uruguay didn’t make it through the qualification. The era of the former South American super power seemed to be over, Uruguay would never again come close to its previous results.
The national team of Hungary who had dominated the European football for a long time would be cut short due to the Hungarian revolution which forced many players to leave the country. The new, unproven Hungarian team wouldn’t make it through the group phase, instead the big surprise team Wales would take the second place in the group along with Sweden to the next stage.
A new star would be born in the 1958 World Cup. After a bleak draw in their premier match against England two new players would be given the chance in the Brazilian team in the next match: Garrincha and Pelé . Brazil would reach the all the way and the 17 old Péle would be the youngest ever in a World Cup final. Not only was he the youngest, he did also one of the most memorable goals ever in the World Cup in the final against Sweden … A high ball into the penalty box, Pelé jumps and stop it with his breast in front of a defender, the next defender are approaching but Pelé show his already granted genius by effortless lob the ball over and then by a volley shot it into the goal.
Pelé was not the only one  making history. Just Fontaine made 13 goals for France and this is today an unbeaten record in the World Cup. The FIFA 1958 World Cup would also get some attention for rough and unfair manners on the field. Oddly enough substitutions were still not allowed and an injury would lead to a missing player for the team.

Results
-------
West Germany, Northern Ireland, France, Yugoslavia, Sweden, Wales, Brazil and Soviet would advance to the knockout stage. Brazil, France, Sweden and West Germany would go on to the Semi-finals from which Brazil and Sweden would go ahead to play in the final The final would see the home team Sweden unable to resist the Brazilians. The final score 5-2 would be a goal record in a World Cup final (the former record was six goals in the 1930 final).

==============
T he seventh World Cup was played in Chile from May 30 to June 17. The qualifications that had started two years earlier included 57 national teams. Of these, 14 teams manage to go on to the final tournament together with the automatically qualified host nation Chile and reigning champions Brazil.

Background
----------
Chile was an unexpected choice as the host for the seventh World Cup. Argentina had seemed more likely since it was South Americas turn, but due to political instability in Argentina at this time Chile was instead nominated.
Despite that African and Asian nations would participate in the qualification round, only American and European nations would partake in the final tournament. The African and Asian teams had to play extra qualification matches against European teams that decreased their chances. No African nation would reach the final tournament until 1970 when FIFA finally gave Confederation of African Football one guaranteed place.

Format
------
The rule that dictated a replay after a draw was abandoned and goal difference was instead used if two teams would have the same amount of points in the groups. The goal difference gave advantage to teams with less conceded goals which contributed to defensive tactics.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The matches of the World Cup in 1962 was taking place in three different cities and stadiums. It was prearranged to be eight stadiums, but a megathrust earthquake in Valdiva (south of Santiago), with magnitude about 9.5 affected the plans. Besides the national stadium in Santiago the remaining three stadiums were very small being World Cup stadiums with capacities under 20,000.

Tournament
----------
Despite an injured Péle, Brazil managed to defend their title. They did so by beating Czechoslovakia in the final by 3-1. With Péle on the bench the big star was Garincha . Another big football name that was participating in the 1962 World Cup was Ferenc Puskás, but this time for the Spanish national team after he had changed nationality due to the Hungarian Revolution. Great footballs stars that change nationality and team was at this time quite common (but would soon be changed by new rules). Chile managed to eliminate Soviet Union, winners of the  first European Championship, in the Quarter-finals and finally win the bronze medal and once again proved the traditionally advantage of being a home nation in the World Cup (except in 1962 Chile has never succeeded to go further than the first round in the knockout phase). Some games were very rough and the brutality escalated several times into fighting incidents in which boxing and kicking took place on the field. The worse scenes were displayed in the game between Chile and Italy , infamously known as ""La batalla de Santiago"", which has become known as  one of the most scandalous matches in the World Cup history. The disgraceful events culminated with a long brawl whereas one of the Italians players would finally be assisted from the field with the help of local police.
Just like the previous World Cup tournament no substitutes were allowed, what could have served as incitements to unjust play. Neither was yellow and red cards yet taken into practice  – a player could however be sent off and this happened six times in the Chile tournament.

Results
-------
Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, West Germany, Chile, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Italy would advance from the group phase. In the Quarter-finals Chile, Brazil, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia won their matches and were going through to the Semi-finals. Chile world face Brazil and Yugoslavia were facing Czechoslovakia. It would be Brazil and Czechoslovakia that would be contesting in the final for the FIFA World Cup trophy. By winning in 1962 Brazil defended its title and became the second nation ever to do that – Italy had been the first winning in 1934 and 1938.

1ee49f45-b977-45fd-a9c2-5566deecfd22,England,1966,"World Cup 1966
==============
T he eighth World Cup was played in England 11-30 July in 1966. The qualifications for the final tournament included 70 national teams (Africa was boycotting the tournament due to a new rule that forced the winners from the continent to partake in a play-off against Asian teams). Of these, 14 teams succeed to qualify for the final phase of the World Cup  along with the automatically qualified host nation England and the reigning champions Brazil .

Background
----------
In 1960, it was decided that the country there association football once had been born  finally would be the host for the biggest tournament in the game.
The Third World on the other hand was still not considered worthy to earn full membership in the greatest sport on earth. An increased amount of African nations had become members of FIFA, but neither this time was the Confederation of African Football permitted a guaranteed place in the final tournament. Upset by the treatment, all African teams would react with a complete boycott.
This lead to a diminished qualification in the Africa, Asia and Oceania zone, including only two teams: Australia and North Korea. The latter would advance to the final phase for the first time.
The colored pictures that have been spread from the 1966 World Cup in England (you can see some below), has been added with color afterwards; the television audience in 1966 had to follow the games in black and white. But they could on the other hand for the first time see slow-motion replays from matches that were broadcast live.
Another novelty was drug tests that for the first time were put into practice by FIFA in a World Cup.

Format
------
The format was the same as the previous World Cup with a group phase (every group included four teams) which preceded a knock-out phase with eight teams.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
Arenas in seven towns including two located in London were used for the tournament. The final was played at Wembley Stadium that at this time had a capacity of almost 100,000. The average attendance (48,847) in the whole tournament would beat the old record (47,511) from the 1950 World Cup .

Tournament
----------
England didn't look like a prospective championship in the first match against Uruguay (the first ever World Cup match played in floodlights). Despite the bleak impression given in the premiere and some mixed performance as the tournament progress, the home nation made the dream come true by winning their first World Cup title. Among  the big names in the English side were Gordon Banks, Bobby Charlton and Geoff Hurst. In the final England defeated West Germany after extra time in a monumental game. One of the most debated goals in World Cup history occurred after a shot by Geoff Hurst hit the crossbar and bounced down near the goal line. It was decided as over the goal line by the referee, but a debate would go on for decades afterwards if the ball was over the goal line or not. An extensive report by Ian Reid and Andrew Zisserman later claimed with the help of modern technology that the ball never was over the line.
The biggest performer in the tournament, however, was arguably the Portuguese player Eusébio . Portugal came third after losing against England in semi-final and defeating Soviet Union in the third-place match. Just as in the previous World Cup  would some matches display a great deal of unsportsmanship. Uruguay against West Germany became a scandalous match in which a Uruguayan player disputed with the police after being sent off. Brazil that  had won the latest two championships gave a bleak performance and was out  already in the group phase with Pelé half injured. The fact that the opponent  players could neutralize the skills of Pelé with unjust tackles was a shame (and  for Pelé itself it was reason enough for retired from international football, until he changed his mind two years later).
Italy did  an even bigger fiasco than Brazil, which was definite after a humiliating loss  against North Korea. This was their last match in the group and lead to a  missed advancement. North Korea would be close to follow-up with another  sensation when taking a lead with three goals to nothing against Portugal in the quarter-finals. Their Portuguese  opponents would, however, restore the order in the world of football by five  consecutive goals.

Results
-------
England, Argentina, Portugal, North Korea, West Germany, Uruguay, Soviet Union and Hungary would make it through the group phase and on to the knockout stage. In the Quarter-finals England, Portugal, West Germany and Soviet Union won their matches. And in the Semi-finals England and West Germany won. In the final England would beat West Germany in a dramatic and unforgettable match that needed extra time to separate the sides. Geoff Hurst did three of his teams four goals and became the first player scoring three times in a World Cup final.

==============
W hen the ninth World Cup was played in Mexico it was the first time the tournament wasn't played in Europe or South America. The dates for the tournament were 31 May-21 June. The qualifications for the final tournament included 75 national teams and among these 14 teams qualified for the World Cup final tournament (Israel was the first representatives of the Asian-Confederation in the history of the tournament, and El Salvador and Morocco made also their first appearances). In addition, the automatically qualified host nation Mexico and England as the reigning champions were included.

Background
----------
In 1964, it was decided that Mexico would be host country for the ninth World Cup. At that time Mexico was a nation that had accomplished very little in global football tournaments and the more reputable Argentina were displeased  being overlooked once again. The FIFA World Cup 1970 was the first World Cup ever broadcast on television in color (notice that some countries still hadn't the possibility to watch color television). It was also the first World Cup with an officially sponsored ball. The manufacturer Adidas had created the ball, called Telstar.

Format
------
The tournament format would be divided into a group and a knockout phase. The first phase consisted of four groups in which two out of four teams would advance to the final knockout phase.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
Five stadiums were used for the tournament located in five towns. The final was played at the mighty Azteca Stadium with a capacity of over 100,000. The average attendance for the whole tournament would for the first time exceed 50,000.

Tournament
----------
Two new rules were taken into practice for the first time in the World Cup. Substitutions that oddly enough hasn’t been allowed in previous World Cups were now employed  – two per team in a game. The second new rule was the introduction of the red and yellow card (it had been tested in the 1968 Olympics). The referee Kurt Tschenscher would show the first historical yellow card in the opening match between Mexico and Russia. Despite that the red card hasn't been used earlier in World Cup, players had been sent of the pitch (somewhat curiously, no player in this tournament want shown a red card).
Brazil hadn't impressed in the last World Cup, neither  participated in the last South American Championship before the 1970 World Cup. They had, however, impressed in the qualification and new young players like Gérson and Jairzinho together with Pelé and Rivellino would be components in what became a classic national team.
The reigning champions England had a strong team, but would be eliminated by West Germany in a memorable match. West Germany would meet Italy in one of the Semi-finals that would include seven goals and a ticket to the final for the Italians.
Brazil took revenge from the defeat in World Cup 1950 by beating the Urugyans in the other Semi-final. The final match that followed between Brazil and Italy was seen as a battle between futebol d'arte (football as art) and futebol de resultados (playing for the result). Brazil that  represented the art would deliver another  marvelous performance and  becoming the first nation in history of the World Cup to claim three victories (they would also be the first team in a World Cup since Uruguay in 1930 to win all their matches and in ordinary match time). As a result, they would instead of Italy (which  also had two previous titles), apprehended the Jules Rimet Trophy forever. Some football historians are considering this  tournament as the end of an era. Jonathan Wilson writes ""for the last time in  major competition, there was space"" and ""never again would a side enjoy such success simply by throwing their best players on the field"".

Results
-------
Soviet Union, Uruguay, Brazil, Peru, Italy, Mexico, West Germany succeeds to go on from the groups to the knockout stage. Uruguay, Brazil, Italy and West Germany won their quarter-finals. Brazil would beat Uruguay in the first Semi-final and Italy would be West Germany in the second, which was an utterly dramatic. West Germany would win the match of third place and in the final Brazil would beat Italy with 4-1.
Brazil celebrates victory.

==============
T he tenth World Cup was played in West Germany between 13 June and 7 July. The qualifications for the final tournament involved 98 national teams. For the final tournament 16 teams would be contending the title as world champions. Australia, East Germany , Haiti and Zaire participated for the first time. As the host nation, West Germany was automatically qualified and so was Brazil as the title holder.

Background
----------
Security would be high on the agenda since the horrific Munich massacre two years earlier in the Summer Olympics when terrorists killing eleventh athletics. All matches and accommodations of the teams were highly guarded. For the World Cup in 1974 a new trophy was introduced (Brazil had won the Jules Rimet Trophy permanently due to three victories). The new trophy was just called FIFA World Cup Trophy. It was created by Silvio Gazzaniga and made of 18 karat gold and the green ring lawyers on the lower part were made of malachite. Apart from the previous trophy the ruling for the new trophy prevent any nation from winning it permanently.

Format
------
The format was made out by two group phases, with eight teams advancing to the second phase, followed by a match of third place and a final. No Quarter – or Semi-finals were played.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The 1974 World Cup was played at nine stadiums, in nine cities.

Tournament
----------
The 1974 version of Brazil was not a worthy follow up to the brilliant team that won in 1970. Its players showed more brutality than characteristic samba skills against Holland in the second group phase. The   bleak performance could partly be explained from the fact that Pelé had retired and Gérson, in addition to  some other key players, was injured. A team that still treated football as an art form was instead the Netherlands. According to many the best team in the tournament, Netherlands led by Johan Cruyff won five times and draw once until the final. Netherlands that hadn't been in a World Cup final tournament since 1938, practiced a tactic game style that has been known as total football and was originally initiated by AFC Ajax . Their opponent in the final, West Germany, had been favorites for the title before the tournament thanks to their victory in the European Championship two years earlier (their coach was Helmut Schön, who had been the assistant to Sepp Herberger when West Germany became world champions in 1954). But West Germany's path to the final wasn't as smooth as the Netherlands and the very special meeting with East Germany would in fact end with a loss.
The final got a chocking start. Before they  had touched the ball once, the Germans could only stop the advance from Cruyff with a tackle in the penalty area. The penalty would result in 1-0 to the Netherlands, but neither this time would Netherlands earn the World Cup title.

Results
-------
From the first group phase (including four groups with four teams in each) these eight teams advanced: East Germany, West Germany, Yugoslavia, Brazil, Netherlands, Sweden, Poland, Argentina, Netherlands and Brazil. From the second group phase (included two groups with four teams in each) these teams advanced: Netherlands, Brazil, West Germany and Poland. Poland would when win the match for third place against Brazil. In the final the home nation West Germany would face Netherlands. West Germany would in the end win by 2-1.

==============
T he eleventh World Cup was played in Argentina 1-25 June. A total of 107 national teams were involved in qualifications for the final tournament from which 15 would advance to the final tournament. For the first time only the host nation was automatically qualified and not the title holder (this rule has when lasted). For the world champion title would consequently 16 teams be competing (for the last time by the way,  the following World Cup final tournament would be extended to 24 teams).

Background
----------
West Germany was the reigning world championship, but  this time without both Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd Müller . The runners-up from 1974, Netherlands, would also be without their biggest star, Johan Cruyff .
  The biggest expectations before the tournament were instead on players like Karl-Heinz Rummenigge (West Germany), Roberto Bettega (Italy), Rivellino in (Brazil), Michel Platini (France) and Mario Kempes (Argentina). The  tournament would to some extent be overshadowed by political circumstances. The  junta had taken over the power in Argentina two years earlier and they would  use the event to benefit their own interests. The turbulent times in the country  had not been ideal for the preparations and the organizing were far behind  schedule, to the point that moving the whole tournament to Spain was considered  by FIFA. But the new government would make drastic prioritization and, in the  end, the tournamennt would go on as planned.

Format
------
The set-up that had been taken into practice 1974 with two group phases was copied. The best two teams from four groups would be gathered in another two four-team groups. From each of these groups would the winners meet in a final and the follow-ups would meet in the match for third price.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The 1978 World Cup was played at six stadiums, in five cities. Estadio Monumental was the largest and would serve as the venues for the final and eight other games (including the majority of Argentina’s matches).

Tournament
----------
Tunisia’s victory over Mexico would mark the first time an African team won a match in a FIFA World Cup final.
Argentina was because of the home advantage one of the favorites, but on the other hand, Argentina had much to prove since they lacked a big trophy in a global tournament. The belief in an offensive football by the charismatic coach Cesar Luís Menotti was combined with some unjust conducts.
The less sympathetic features of the Argentinian team were featured in the match against Brazil . The rivalry between the teams produced a violent encounter in which the 0-0 result was symptomatic for a match that show little constructiveness.
After the 0-0 draw between Argentina and Brazil in the second group phase, Brazil would go on by beating Poland with 3-1. As a result, Argentina was  forced to win by a four goal margin in their last match. And they did more than that, beating Peru by six against nothing. Because of the circumstances and the result, the match has been controversial and by some claimed to the fixed. But the football journalist and historian Jonathan Wilson writes ""It is doubtful that anybody watching the video of the game with no knowledge of context would see anything untoward"". In fact Peru started the match aggressively and almost got the lead, and the performance from Argentina was sensational whereas Peru had nothing to play for. Thanks to that 6-0 win, Argentina won the group by goal difference and moved on to their first World Cup final since 1930.
The final became somewhat ugly in aspects of brutal football. In a match that was dramatic in many aspects, the final outcome was delayed by 30 minutes extra time. In the added  time, Argentina scored twice and it  ended with a new defeat for the Netherlands and with the first World Cup victory for Argentina. The crowd cheered and Mario Kempes would be the biggest hero.
Most memorable was perhaps the characteristic images of the white confetti  snowing at the home teams matches including the final.

Results
-------
Italy, Argentina, Poland, West Germany, Austria, Brazil, Peru and the Netherlands would advance from the first group phase. Netherlands and Argentina would win the groups in the second group phase, and therefore face each other in the final. The runners-up from the two groups, Italy and Brazil would play for the third place. Brazil would win the third place match with 2-1 against Italy and Argentina would win the final with 3-1 versus Netherlands.

==============
T he twelfth World Cup was played in Spain from 13 June to 11 July. The final phase of the FIFA World Cup had expanded from 16 to 24 teams, which was natural due to the increase of participating nations in the qualifications (a total of 103 teams for the 1982 World Cup in comparison with 57 twenty years earlier). The enlarged proportions of African and Asian nations were especially noticeable (in 1994 FIFA decided to give yet another place to Africa).

Background
----------
Argentina arrived in Spain as the reigning champions. The star of the previous tournament, Mario Kempes, was not in the same form. But a new young star was about to enter the world stage: Diego Maradona . Unfortunately for Argentina, Maradona’s skills were ramshackle by brute defending and in the end his revenge caused by frustration led to a red card.

Format
------
The set-up for the final tournament was a first phase with six four team groups  – two teams from every group advance to a second group phase with four three teams groups. The group winners in the second phase would go on to Semi-finals. A novelty was that penalty-shootout was introduced to decide matches in the knockout phase that still not decided after extra time.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The 1982 World Cup was played at 17 stadiums in 14 Spanish cities. Although Nou Camp had the biggest capacity, the final was played at Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid.

Tournament
----------
The 1982 included several sensations with underdogs that shook European giants. Cameroon didn't lose a single match, but was unlucky then Italy – the coming champions  – by the slightest goal difference advance on Cameroons cost. Honduras  managed to achieve a draw in their first match against the host nation Spain . Another astonish result was Algerians 2-1 victory against West Germany (one of the biggest favorites after winning the UEFA Euro 1980). Algeria would share Cameroon's destiny by being eliminated by goal difference.
The ambitions of the home nation Spain was disintegrated by a mediocre team. After the half fiasco in the opening match, they probably haven't won the second match either if not the referee had given them a very dubious penalty and –  after the penalty kicker missed –  letting him take it again.
The most entertaining teams were arguably Brazil and France . A fine edition of a Brazil (with players like Zico, Socrates and Falcão) would destroy Argentina’s chances to advance further, but after a somewhat sloppy loss against Italy, the Brazilians were also gone from advancing to the knockout stage.
The less entertaining teams of Italy and West Germany would reach better results and would finally play for the trophy. The West Germany team would't exactly charm the football world. Especially the match against Austria was almost absent of initiatives, after an early goal, since both teams could play on the result and advance (the rule that the last two matches in the group were played simultaneously was still not implemented).
The final has often been called the best World Cup game ever. Both teams include players of the highest class that today are placed in the football pantheon.  Brazil had players such as Júnior, Sócrates and Zico, and in Italy there were among others Dino Zoff , Marco Tardelli and Paulo Rossi.

Results
-------
Poland, Italy, West Germany, Austria, Belgium, Argentina, England, France, Northern Ireland, Spain, Brazil and Soviet Union succeed from first group phase into the second. Poland, West Germany, Italy and France would when winning their groups in the second group phase and advanced to the knockout stage. Italy would beat Poland and West Germany would beat France in the semi-finals. Poland defeated France in the third price match and Italy won the final against West Germany with 3-1.
Tardelli's celebration in the final is a picture that stays in the memory.

==============
T he 13th World Cup was played in Mexico from 31 May to 29 June. In the final phase of the FIFA World Cup 24 teams were participating after a qualification that included 121 nations. As host nation, Mexico was automatically qualified.

Background
----------
The 13th World Cup was actually planned to be arranged in Columbia, but a country in economic crises decided to back out of the large arrangement. The United States and Canada wanted both to take over as host nation, but Mexico was chosen. A controversial decision since Mexico already had been the host once and rather recently as well (1970); money had a big role in the outcome.
The hostship of Mexico was however in jeopardy after a major earthquake in Mexico City, causing thousands of casualties eight months before the tournament. But the country managed to go through the event in line with plans.
Among the anticipated stars of the tournament were Enzo Francescoli, Michel Platini , Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Gary Lineker, Hugo Sánchez , Michael Laudrup and Diego Maradona . It turned out to be Diego Maradona’s World Cup and perhaps no player before had managed to raise above all other players in a World Cup tournament like he had done in 1986.

Format
------
The format consisted of a group phase of six groups (two teams from every group plus four third-placed teams advanced on) and a knockout phase. The knockout phase directly after a group phase instead of a second group phase meant a restoration of the set-up used in 1970 and several other earlier tournaments.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The 1986 World Cup was played at twelve stadiums in eleven cities. The biggest stadium was Estadio Azteca with capacity for 114 600 people and it became also the first arena in which the World Cup final had been played in twice).

Tournament
----------
When the expansion to 24 teams  had been implemented in 1982, two groups rounds been practiced. In 1986 a different format were used  with 16 out of 24 teams advancing from the groups to a knockout stage. This resulted in two teams (Bulgaria and Uruguay) did advance to the knockout phase despite no won matches and one lost match. After all, the biggest sensation in the group phase was not Argentina , but arguably Denmark . In their first World Cup final ever, they won all games in the group phase, much owing to the team's attack consisting of Michael Laudrup and Preben Elkjær. The saga would abruptly end in the knockout stage after a 1-5 defeat against Spain . The home team boosted by passionate audience and the Real Madrid striker Hugo Sánchez would redeem the nation until a cold shower against West Germany in the Quarter-final.
One of the high points of the tournament was the quarter-final match between Brazil and France in which France finally won after a penalty shoot-out. France would in the next match experience the ability of the West Germany  to be best when it means the most. In the final West Germany was the underdog against Maradona's Argentina.

Results
-------
Argentina, Italy, Bulgaria, Mexico, Paraguay, Belgium, Soviet Union, France, Brazil, Spain, Denmark, West Germany, Morocco, England and Poland succeed to advance from the group phase into the knockout stage. Argentina, West Germany, France, England, Mexico, Belgium, Brazil and Spain won the matches in the Round of 16. Argentina, West Germany, France and Spain won the matches in the Quarter-finals. Argentina and West Germany won the semi-finals and would go to the final.
France would beat Belgium in the third place match and Argentina defeated West Germany in the final with 3-2.

47a8dd4e-4426-4d32-9942-1d427958c1f7,Italy,1990,"World Cup 1990
==============
T he 14th World Cup was played in Italy from 8 June to 8 July. A total of 116 national teams had participated in the qualification and 24 would go on to the final phase of the FIFA World Cup including the automatically qualified home team (Italy) and reigning champions (Argentina). Costa Rica, the Republic of Ireland and the United Arab Emirates  made their first appearances.

Background
----------
Soviet Union was the only other candidate (after England and Greece had withdrawn) when Italy in 1984 was chosen to be World Cup host for the second time.
One of the matters that dominated the discussions before the event was the England supporters, among hooligans were included and  would be a potential risk factor. If it was a  coincidence or not that England’s matches were scheduled to be played at  Sardinia remains to be answered, but many felled comforted. A novelty,  brought to the game to support a more offensive attitude, was the abolishing of  the back pass. Another novelty was a harder ruling against the tackle from  behind, which now could directly give a red card.

Format
------
The format consisted of a group phase of six groups (two teams from every group plus four third-placed teams advanced on), followed by a knockout phase.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The 1990 World Cup was played at twelve stadiums in twelve Italian cities. Stadio Olimpico in Rome was the biggest in aspect of capacity and would also be chosen as the venue for the final.

Tournament
----------
The champions from 1986, Argentina , would suffer a chock by losing against Cameroon in the opening match. Argentina managed to advance from the group by the slightest margin and would go on all the way to the final, in two occasions by winning at penalty shootouts (much owing to Sergio Goycochea, a goalkeeper specialized on penalties).
Cameroon managed to go on to the Quarter-finals and reach the best result ever for an African team in World Cup football. They were defeated by England in an entertaining game. After their victory against the African sensation, England  almost marched on to their second World Cup final, but an unfortunate penalty shootout in the semifinal wretched the dream.
It would instead be another final for West Germany , a team led by players like Lothar Matthäus, Jürgen Klinsmann and Andreas Brehme. West Germany had impressed more than their final opponents, by winning their group and also by winning one of the tournament’s most unforgettable games. The match between the football titans West Germany and Netherlands would also be remembered for a shameful incident in which Frank Rijkaard spit on Rudi Voller. With Rijkaard sent off and Marco van Basten and Ruud Gullit underperforming, West Germany took a deserved victory. The final was not especially entertaining. Argentina who missed their important striker Claudio Caniggia played defensive and rough. As a result, Pedro Monzón and Gustavo Dezotti became the first ever to receive red cards in a World Cup final.

Results
-------
Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Yugoslavia, Republic of Ireland, Romania, Italy, Uruguay, Czechoslovakia, Costa Rica, West Germany, Netherlands, Cameroon, Colombia, England and Belgium would advance from the group phase. Argentina, Yugoslavia, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Czechoslovakia, West Germany, Cameroon and England would win their matches in the Round of 16. Argentina, Italy, West Germany and England would win their Quarter-final matches. Argentina would beat Italy and West Germany would beat England in the Semi-finals. Italy would win the match for third place and West Germany would win over Argentina in the final and becomes the new world champions.
German celebration.

0cbabbdb-fbb4-4228-aae0-68edc3bb363d,Unites States,1994,"World Cup 1994
==============
T he 15th World Cup was played in United States from 17 June to 17 July. The final stage of FIFA World Cup was preceded by a qualification that included 147 national teams. Among these 24 would go on to the World Cup final tournament, including the automatically qualified United Stated as the home team and Germany as the reigning champions. Greece, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia had succeeded in qualifying for the first time.

Background
----------
Since the 1990 World Cup had produced the lowest goals per match figure ever in the tournament, FIFA made some changes with the idea to create a more offensive game in the 1994 World Cup. The goalkeeper would no longer be allowed to take up the ball with his hands if the ball had come from a teammate. Another rule change was that a player that fouled another player with the ball and only the goalkeeper between himself and the goal would get a red card. A third rule change was that a team gained three instead of two points for a win.
Referees had also got instructions to be harder on fouls and the line referees were instructed to blow for offside only when completely sure (a somewhat strange criterion). Apart from the new rules the referees would  for the first time no longer wear traditionally black shirts.
From the perspective that the 1994 World Cup was characterized by attacking game, the rule changes reach their goals (this was relatively speaking, the goals per match were actually not much higher than in 1990).

Format
------
Same set-up was used as in the previous World Cup tournament. The teams were divided into six four groups from which the best two teams in each plus four third placed teams advanced to a  knockout phase.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The 1994 World Cup was played in nine cities and with the same amount of arenas. For the first time some matches would be played indoor, in the Pontiac Silverdome.

Tournament
----------
The two biggest sensations in the tournament were Sweden and Bulgaria. Sweden, elevated to a new level by players like Tomas Brolin and Martin Dahlin, was near their second World Cup final and Bulgaria, with the Barcelona player Hristo Stoichkov , could have reached their first. Instead, the teams would meet each other in the match of third place. The World Cup trophy would once again be lifted by Brazilians players and their striker Romário was arguably the biggest reason to it. The last game was, however an example of how hesitant and careful a final in big football tournaments sometimes tend to be.
Two events that not occurred chiefly on the pitch shadowed the sporting aspects. The first was Diego Maradona that abruptly departed from the tournament after testing positive for ephedrine, a non allowed substance used for weight loss. Maradona had made a comeback in the Argentinian national team and had lost 20 pounds in a short time. He showed some brilliance on the field against Greece, but Argentina had to manage without him in the remaining matches (his substitute Ortega, who presented a playing style what mirrored Maradona's, got instead a breakthrough).
The second event that gave a shadow over the tournament was the gruesome murder of the Colombian defender Andrés Escobar whose unlucky own goal against United States would lead to him getting murdered after he returned to Colombia.

Results
-------
Brazil would defeat Italy in the final and for the first time in World Cup history the final match would be a draw after both ordinary match time and extra time. The match would therefore be decided by a penalty shootout in which Brazil won after Italy had missed their third penalty.

==============
T he 16th World Cup was played in France States from 10 June to 12 July. The World Cup had expanded from the previous 24 teams to 32. The main reason was that the amount of involved nations in the qualification stages had increased to 174 nations, 27 more than in the previous World Cup.

Background
----------
After being blacklisted under a long period for the apartheid, South Africa made their first appearance in FIFA World Cup. Yugoslavia had been banned from several competitions due to the Balkan War, now they were back and also Croatia for the first time since their independence. The same was true for Jamaica that  for the first time had qualified for the final tournament.

Format
------
The increased amount of teams resulting in that the number of groups were increased from six to eight. Two teams from every group would advance to the knock-out phase. Golden Goal was introduced, which stipulated that a goal in extra time would end the match. The motivation behind the rule was to give more reasons for playing offensive in extra time and by that decrease the numbers of matches decided on penalty shoot-out –  the rule did however not succeed with this.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The matches would be played in ten cities and the same amount of stadiums (see “Cities and stadiums” box for overview). The biggest stadium where the final was played was Stade de France in Saint-Denis (near Paris) which had a capacity of 80,000.

Tournament
----------
One of the matches  in Group F was special due to the political conflicts that had surrounded the two nations, United States and Iran. United States was seen as ""the big Satan"" in Iran, but when the nations met at the football field mutual respect were given.
The home team France would hold up to the pressure and could finally win the tournament, but not without difficulties. The star Zinedine Zidane would get a red card after a stupid kick against a player. France would still win the group and Zidane would return to the team after one match suspension. In the Round of 16, France needed extra time to score a goal against Paraguay, and they were forced to gamble against Italy in the next game with a penalty-shootout.
The German team included many older players, and they would be crushed by Croatia in the Quarter-finals. Argentina was going for their third title and had a dribbler in the Maradona-like Ortega – Ortega would, however lose his temper (as Maradona in 1982) and was sent off after head-butting the Holland goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. The Dutch team showed the rest of the world an unpleasant discord based on the contradiction between black and white players. The team would, nevertheless,  perform at a high level and was very close to reach the final. Until the final many though that Ronaldo's brilliance would serve Brazil another World Cup title in similar fashion as Romario’s brilliance had done four years earlier. His appearance in the final was, however, only a shadow of himself, and the rest of the Brazilian team were seemingly affected by Ronaldo's poor condition. Already before the match something strange seemed to be going on: the Brazilian team didn't go out to the warm up. Afterwards, many rumors said different things. What actually had happened was that Ronaldo had collapsed before the game, but if it was a nervous breakdown, an epileptic seizure or something else have remained unanswered.

Results
-------
France would beat Brazil in the final with 3-0, the biggest goal difference in a World Cup final since 1958.
The French squad celebrates after the final victory.

==============
T he 17th World Cup was played in South Korea and Japan from 31 May to 30 June. For the first time the World Cup tournament was held in Asia and for the first time was the hostship shared by two nations. A total of 199 nations, a record, were involved in the qualification. Finally, 32 teams would be competing in the final tournament (including the three automatically qualified nations –  the both host nations plus the reigning champions). China, Ecuador, Senegal and Slovenia entered the tournament for the first time.

Background
----------
South Korea or Japan were hardly obvious candidates as hosts for the biggest football tournament in the world. Instead of bringing the action to a place associated with football tradition, the reason for the choice were mainly based on an attempt to expand the game into a new market with billions of people.

Format
------
The same model as in the previous tournament was kept. A first stage consisting of group play, two teams from eight groups would go on to play in the knockout phase consisting of four rounds.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The matches would be played at ten stadiums in South Korea and ten stadiums in Japan. The final would be played at International Stadium Yokohama in the Japanese city of Yokohama. This was also the stadium with the biggest capacity (70,000).

Tournament
----------
The French team that had won the previous World Cup had also won the latest European Championship and arrived as one of the favorites. France was, however, diluted by injuries on the two key players Zinedine Zidane (that would join the team in the third game) and Robert Pires. The road for another victory would, however turn into a large fiasco. It began in the first match against Senegal –  a former French colony which national team consisted of players belonging to the French clubs, among some were in the second division. Senegal won and France would be placed last in the group with only one point and no scored goals.
The French failure was one of many great failures in FIFA World Cup 2002. Perhaps the biggest favorites before the tournament, Argentina , didn't go through to the knockout stage. The analyses could conclude that Argentina had had more possessions   and more corners than any other team. Despite that, the team managed only to score twice, what may have been because of a tactical formation that made them easy to defend against. Portugal would meet the same destiny as Argentine whereas Italy would  be eliminated directly in the knockout phase against the sensation South Korea.
South Korea would be the greatest sensation. After defeating Italy, they eliminated Spain in the Quarter-finals and until the saga ended with a 0-1 defeat in the Semi-finals. The marvelous success for this completely unknown team would also be seen plenty disaffection. Some felt that the team had been favored by the referees and especially would the game against Spain –  with two goals for Spain rejected –  be controversial.
The final would be played by the two superpowers in the game, Brazil and Germany , whom strangely enough never before had faced each other in a World Cup match. Germany was once again in a final without impressing especially much in the tournament so far, and furthermore was one of their most important players, Michael Ballack, secluded in the final.
A remaining impression in hindsight was that the great teams and the great players  performed at the expected level. One plausible reason was that they were tired already before the start of the tournament. The numbers of matches in the World Cup qualifications and also in the big European club tournaments had also increased in numbers of games. The reason behind was the money to could be made from matches for media companies and other involved organizers. When it was time for the biggest event on earth the main attractions (e.i. the star players) were unfortunately not always in the best shape.

Results
-------
France would beat Brazil in the final with 3-0, the biggest goal difference in a World Cup final since 1958.

==============
T he 18th World Cup was played in Germany from 9 June to 9 July in 2006. After a qualification phase including total of 198 nations, 32 teams would be competing in the last phase of the tournament, including the automatically qualified host nation Germany (for the first time   since the rule was introduced 1938, the reigning champions was no longer automatically qualified). Angola, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, Czech Republic and Serbia and Montenegro would all do their first World Cup appearances.

Background
----------
Just before the tournament the biggest scandal ever in Italian football, Calcipoli , concerning match-fixing, had  exploded in the football world and many players in the Italian team were in some way affected by it. The events would have a positive impact on their performance and not vice versa.

Format
------
The format consisted of groups with four teams in each from which two teams would advance to a knockout phase.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The matches would be played at twelve stadiums in twelve cities. The final would be played in Berlin at Olympiastadium, with the capacity of 72,000.

Tournament
----------
The match between Germany and Costa Rica which included six goals did become the opening match with most goals in the tournament. Few goals per match, almost a new low record, would, however characterized the tournament as a whole.
The team that impressed most in the group phase may have been Argentina . In the second match against Serbia and Montenegro, Argentina won 6-0 and one of the goals was arguably the best in the World Cup: 24 passes were made before the second goal made by Esteban Cambiasso. Argentina would eliminate Mexico in the Round of 16 after yet another dream goal, this time a shot by Maxi Rodríguez. They would, however, lose on penalties in the next match against Germany.
Germany that effortless had advanced from the group and slammed Sweden in the Round of 16 before the encounter with Argentina would in the next match lose against Italy .
Italy would also win the final against France , when the final for the second time in World Cup history was decided by a penalty shootout. France had taken the lead on a dubious given penalty before Italy's equalizer. But the most talked about incident became the headbutt Zinedine Zidane did on Italian defender Marco Materazzis and that gave him a red card.

Results
-------
Italy would beat France in the final with 5-3, after a penalty shootout.

==============
T he 19th World Cup was played in South Africa from 11 June to 11 July. After a qualification phase, including a total of 204 national teams (a record), 32 teams would be given a place in the final tournament, including the automatically qualified host nation South Africa. Slovakia and Serbia would make their debut in the tournament.

Background
----------
FIFA World Cup 2010 would be historical in terms of the location; it was the first time ever that the tournament was played in Africa (Morocco had been rather close to be the host in 1994, 7 votes against 10 votes for USA). But this time it was decided that the tournament would be arranged in Africa and consequently only African countries candidated for the hosting –  Egypt and Morocco came closest in the bidding process. The football audience that had followed the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup on television had been acquainted with the brass instrument named Vuvuzela, which filled the stadiums with a high and monotonic sound during the games. Since the appearance of Vuvuzelas disturbed a part of the spectators and conceivably the players as well a debate concerning prohibition of the Vuvuzelas arise before the tournament. No ban was, however determined.

Format
------
The format was copied from the previous tournament. Meaning that a first round with a group stage consisting of eight four-team groups would proceed to a second round with a knockout phase.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The  matches would be played in twelve cities and the same amount of stadiums (see  “Cities and stadiums” box for overview). The biggest stadium where the final  was played was Maracana Stadium (Estádio do Maracanã). It had been rebuilt for  the tournament and had a capacity of 74,738 (which could be compared with the  capacity close to 200,000 in 1950).

Tournament
----------
Brazil , Germany , Spain and Argentina were four of the biggest favorites before the start of the tournament. Argentina had the spectacular duo of Diego Maradona as coach and Lionel Messi on the pitch. After impressive performances by the Argentinian side, it would be an abrupt halt with a 0-4 against Germany in the Quarter-finals. Brazil would also be eliminated in the Quarter-finals by Netherlands. Spain and Germany, the other two great favorites, would meet in one of the Semi-finals and the result would be a reprise on the Euro 2008 final between the two teams. In the other of the Semi-finals Netherlands would defeat Uruguay in a somewhat brutal game. The brutality that escalated from the Netherlands side in the final should have resulted in two red cards.
When Andrés Iniesta on extra time scored the only goal in the game for Spain it felt morally deserved. Spain that were the reigning European champions managed to win the following World Cup, which only West Germany had succeeded with before.

Results
-------
Spain would beat the Netherlands in the final with 1-0, after extra time.

==============
T he 20th World Cup in football was held in Brazil from 12 June to 13 July in 2014. It was the second time Brazil  hosted the biggest football tournament on earth, the first time was World Cup 1950 . After a qualification phase including 207 teams (the team of Brazil as host nation didn't need to qualifiy), a sum of 32 teams were participating in the World Cup final stage (Bosnia and Herzegovina did partake for the first time).

Background
----------
The FIFA  World Cup in Brazil was preceded with protests and also  delays in the  construction and rebuilding of stadiums. It was the enormous sums involved in constructing and rebuilding football stadiums for the  event that caused the protests  – that also escalated in wild street demonstrations. The cost for the rebuilding of the Maracana Stadium landed on €335  million. The controversy was fueled by additional circumstances, such as construction  workers died in accidents and that residents around the stadium and other World  Cup related constructions were forced to leave their homes. Most chocking  of all was the allegations that police death patrols had operated before the  tournament in order to clear out the streets from homeless people and other  undesirable elements.

Format
------
The format was copied from the previous tournament. Meaning that a first round with a group stage consisting of eight four-team groups would proceed to a second round with a knockout phase.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The matches would be played at ten stadiums in eleven cities. The final would be played in FNB Stadium in City of Johannesburg, with the capacity of 84,490.

Tournament
----------
Brazil as the home team had high hopes of winning another trophy, and were a favorite because the South American teams traditionally would be known to be strong playing on their own continent – no European had never won a World Cup played at the American continent. Brazil played well and especially spectacular and dangerous for the opponent teams was Neymar. But Neymar was injured after a vicious tackling in the quarter-final against Colombia. This was most probably the biggest reason that the home team in the next match would lose by with humiliating 1-7 against Germany . Germany that seemed unbreakable forced Argentina to play defensively in the final. Argentina was well organized, but in the second part of the extra time could Mario Götze give Germany a 1-0 lead that turned out to be decisive.

Results
-------
Germany  would beat Argentina in the final with 1-0, after extra time.

==============
T he 21st FIFA World Cup was held in Russia from 14 June to 15 July in 2018. It was the first time Russia hosted the tournament. After a qualification process including 210 teams, a new record, it was finally 32 teams left to compete for the trophy (the team of Russia as host nation was automatically qualified). Iceland and Panama managed to qualify for the first time.

Background
----------
The thing  many talked about before the tournament and after it  started was the novelty video assistant referee system (VAR). For the first time in the World Cup, the decisions of the referee could be changed after reviewing the situation by the use of video footage. In addition, situations that the referee had not reacted upon could result in  retrospective action by communications from assistant referees with access to video footage. It was a big step and the system seemed to be of great importance in several games. For example, in penalty situations in which the referee now chould chose to review the situation through video before the taking a final decision. The very first time VAR affected the outcome of a decision was in the match France-Australia, in which France was given a penalty based on video assistance. One of the plausible VAR effect  to suspect was therefore a higher goal average than normal. The goal average was indeed higher than in both 2006 and 2010, but not higher than in 2014.

Format
------
The format was copied from the previous tournament. Meaning that a first round with a group stage consisting of eight four-team groups would proceed to a second round with a knockout phase.

Cities and arenas
-----------------
The matches would be played at twelve stadiums in eleven cities. The final would be played at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow (attendance 78,011).

Tournament
----------
The host nation Russia with a fourth place from 1966 as their so far best World Cup performance was the lowest-ranked team by FIFA, but started in impressive style by beating Saudi Arabia with 5 to 0. They continue to play above expectations by beating Egypt with the hyped Mohamed Salah on field. Uruguay led by the forward duo Luis Suárez and Edinson Cavani, would beat Russia in the third group   match by 3-0, however both teams would go on to the knockout stage. Russia would be involved in two dramatic games in the knockout stage. In the Round of 16 they won after penalties, eliminating Denmark . In the quarter-finals it was their turn to face the bitterness of losing after a penalty-shoot-out. Some of the favorites were in trouble in the group phase. Spain and Portugal in Group B could not be sure on advancement until the final blow in their third games. Argentina would also be involved in a close struggle for the advancement to the next stage, but could secure a ticket to the Round of 16 in the third game. Germany had, however, to leave the tournament after three games after being last in the group and a humiliating loss in the third match against South Korea. Before the 2018 tournament, only eight nations had ever lift the World Cup trophy. When the tournament was reaching the semi-finals two of the teams, Belgium and Croatia , weren’t among these. France would win the first game against Belgium and Croatia would win the second semi-final after England had been one goal ahead. By that,
  Croatia could be a new nation to win the FIFA World Cup. It was yet France that prove to be to strong and would win for the second time (first time in 1998).

Results
-------
France  won the final against Croatia with 4-2 (most goals in a World Cup final during ordinary  time since 1958).

The working conditions was very poor and according to reports over a  thousand migrant workers in Quatar died during the years that followed the  tournament.
